As a developer, staying up-to-date with the latest technologies is an important part of staying competitive in the industry. In the coming dates, there are several tech stack areas that I want to focus on learning and improving my skills in. These areas include TypeScript and Smart Contracts. In this article, I will outline my plans for learning and improving my skills in these areas, including the steps I plan to take and the resources I will use. I will also discuss the benefits and advantages of learning these technologies and how they can help me grow as a developer.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a popular superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. To learn TypeScript, I plan to start by working through some beginner-level tutorials and exercises to get a feel for the language and its core concepts. I will also try using TypeScript in my own projects to get some hands-on experience with the language. As I become more comfortable with TypeScript, I will try working on more advanced projects and challenges to continue improving my skills.

One way I plan to learn and improve my skills in TypeScript is by creating my own npm package called `@calpa/utils`. This package will be a collection of utility functions and modules written in TypeScript that I can use in my projects. By building this package, I will have the opportunity to practice using TypeScript and to get a deeper understanding of how it works. I will also be able to share my package with others and get feedback on my work, which can help me identify areas for improvement and grow as a developer. Overall, creating the `@calpa/utils` package will be a valuable learning experience that will help me become more proficient in using TypeScript and building npm packages.

## Smart Contracts
Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They can be used to facilitate a wide range of transactions, such as real estate purchases, supply chain management, and financial agreements. Smart contracts can help automate and streamline complex business processes, making them more efficient and cost-effective. They can also help reduce the risk of fraud or errors by eliminating the need for intermediaries and enabling direct, peer-to-peer interactions. In addition, smart contracts can be transparent and easily auditable, which can help increase trust and accountability between parties.

There are several reasons why learning about smart contracts might be attractive to me. For one, the use of smart contracts is growing rapidly, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way businesses and organizations conduct transactions and interact with one another. This means that there is likely to be a high demand for professionals with knowledge and skills in smart contracts, including myself. Additionally, learning about smart contracts can help me develop a valuable skill set that can set me apart from other developers and make me more competitive in the job market. Smart contracts also provide an opportunity for me to work on cutting-edge projects and to be at the forefront of technological innovation. Overall, learning about smart contracts can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience that can open up new career opportunities and help me stay current in a rapidly-evolving industry.

## Conclusion

As a full stack software developer, I am excited to embark on this journey to learn and improve my skills in TypeScript and smart contracts. These technologies are at the forefront of innovation and have the potential to revolutionize the way I build and deploy software. By actively learning and practicing with these technologies, I can develop a strong foundation in them and be better prepared to tackle a wide range of projects and challenges in the future.

I hope that you will also take the time to learn and grow your skills in the coming year. It is important to stay current and stay competitive in our field, but it is also important to take care of yourself and enjoy the journey. I wish you a safe and enjoyable rest of the year as we continue to learn and grow as professionals.
