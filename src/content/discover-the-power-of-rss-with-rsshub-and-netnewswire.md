## Introduction

Stay informed and connected with RSS, RSSHub, and NetNewsWire. In this article, we'll explore how these technologies can help you keep track of updates from your favorite websites and publications. Customize your news feed, choose your sources, and take control of the content you see with RSS. RSSHub allows you to generate custom feeds, while NetNewsWire is a news reader application for Mac and iOS devices.

## What is RSS?

RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a standardized format for distributing and sharing content such as news articles or blog posts. It allows users to easily stay up-to-date with their favorite websites and publications by subscribing to their RSS feeds. An RSS feed is a stream of content that is regularly updated with new articles or posts. When you subscribe to an RSS feed, you can receive updates from that website or publication in a news reader application, such as NetNewsWire.

One of the benefits of using RSS is that it allows you to **customize your news feed and choose the sources you want to follow**. This is in contrast to social media platforms, which often use algorithms to suggest content based on your past behavior or the popularity of the content. By using RSS, you have greater control over the type of content you see and the information you consume. Additionally, RSS is a decentralized technology that is not controlled by any single company or entity, which makes it a more open and transparent way to consume news and information.

Many modern websites and platforms do not provide RSS feeds, which can make it difficult for users to stay up-to-date with their favorite sources of information and content. In response to this challenge, DIYGod created RSSHub, an open-source platform that allows users to generate custom RSS feeds for a wide variety of websites and services. With RSSHub, users can create feeds for specific users, hashtags, or keywords, as well as feeds for search results or curated collections of content. This makes it easier for more people to use RSS to subscribe to their favorite feeds and stay informed and connected to the latest news and information.

## What is RSSHub?

[RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/) is an open-source project that provides an easy-to-use platform for generating RSS feeds for a wide variety of websites and services. It allows users to create custom feeds by providing a template or "recipe" that specifies the URL of the website or service and the desired content to include in the feed. RSSHub supports a wide range of sources, including social media platforms, online news outlets, and video streaming services. It can generate feeds for specific users, hashtags, or keywords, as well as feeds for search results or curated collections of content.

In addition to generating custom feeds, RSSHub also provides a directory of pre-made feeds for popular websites and services. This allows users to easily subscribe to feeds for their favorite sources without having to create their own recipes. By using RSSHub, users can access content from sources that do not provide their own RSS feeds, or combine multiple sources into a single feed for easier consumption. With RSSHub, you can stay up-to-date with your favorite YouTube channels, Pixiv accounts, or any other source of content that you choose.

If you want to learn more about RSSHub, you may want to check out the documentation available on the RSSHub website. The documentation provides detailed information on how to use RSSHub to generate custom feeds, as well as a list of supported sources and examples of how to create feeds for specific users, hashtags, or keywords.
