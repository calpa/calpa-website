Hello World! I'm a full-stack developer who loves to code with love and peace. I'm pretty skilled with all kinds of front-end tech like React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and GatsbyJS. On the back-end, I've got experience with Node.js, Python, and Express.js. Keeping everything organized and running smoothly is important to me, so I've learned a lot about state management using Redux and Redux Saga. I've also worked with all sorts of databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j. Testing is super important too, so I use Jest to make sure everything is working as it should. And when it's time to deploy, I turn to tools like Docker to get the job done. I've also got experience with lots of other cool tools like Git, Visual Studio Code, Webpack, Babel, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Netlify, RSSHub, and Pipedream.

## Front-end
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: A high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in web development.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds type checking to the language.
- GatsbyJS: A static site generator for React.js that allows developers to create fast, responsive websites.

## Back-end
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.
- Python: A high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in web development and data science.

## State Management
- Redux: A state management library for JavaScript applications.
- Redux Saga: A library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to execute, simple to test, and better at handling failures.

## Database
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- Neo4j: A graph database management system that allows developers to model and query connected data.

## DevOps
- Docker: A tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

## Other Tools
- Git: A version control system for tracking changes in source code.
- Visual Studio Code: A popular code editor developed by Microsoft.
- Webpack: A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
- Babel: A JavaScript compiler that converts newer versions of JavaScript into a backwards compatible version that can run in older browsers.
- GitHub: A web-based version control repository and open-source project hosting platform.
- GitHub Actions: A tool for automating workflows within GitHub.
- Netlify: A platform for building, deploying, and managing modern websites.
- RSSHub: A self-hosted RSS feed generator that allows developers to create custom RSS feeds for various websites.
- Pipedream: A platform for building and deploying serverless integrations and workflows.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the tech stacks that I used in 2022 allowed me to build modern, responsive web applications that met my clients' needs. These included front-end technologies like React.js and JavaScript, back-end technologies like Node.js and Python, state management tools like Redux, testing tools like Jest, and DevOps tools like Docker. With these tools, I was able to deliver high-quality web applications that were fast, scalable, and easy to maintain.
