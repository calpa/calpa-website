TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for large-scale JavaScript applications, and provides features such as classes, interfaces, and modules to make it easier to write and maintain code. TypeScript code can be compiled to JavaScript, making it compatible with any browser or JavaScript environment.
